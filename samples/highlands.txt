Well my heart is in The Highlands, gentle and fair 
Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air 
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow 
Well my heart is in The Highlands 
I am gonna go there when I feel good enough to go 
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams 
Everything was exactly the way that it seems 
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page 
Same old rat race life in the same old cage 
I dont want nothing from anyone, aint that much to take 
Wouldnt know the difference between a real blonde and a fake 
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery 
I wish someone would come and push back the clock for me 
Well my heart is in The Highlands wherever I roam 
Thats where I will be when I get called home  
The wind it whispers to the buckeye trees of rhyme 
Well, my heart's in The Highlands 
I can only get there one step at a time
